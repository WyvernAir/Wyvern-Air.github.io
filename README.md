    <p><strong>Non-Refundable Transactions:</strong> While we aim to accommodate all reasonable refund requests, certain transactions are considered final and non-refundable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Deliverables: All digital products, including aerial photography, video footage, and data collected via drone services, are final once delivered. Due to the nature of digital goods, refunds for these items will not be issued.</li>

Please allow up to 14 business days for us to review and process your refund request. Approved refunds will be issued using the original payment method, and the time it takes to reflect in your account may vary depending on your financial institution. Refunds for services that are partially completed will be prorated based on the percentage of work completed. Any discounts, promotions, or special offers applied at the time of purchase will be deducted from the refundable amount.</p>
    <p>Wyvern Air™ reserves the right to refuse a refund if the services were provided as agreed upon without any deviation. We value your business and are committed to resolving any issues promptly and fairly.</p>
